# Journey in bullet points
If you're here for the science and prefer the minimal story (in a **traditional** CV style), these are my degrees:
 
- **BSc in Exercise and Sports Science** (2016), University of Copenhagen
- **MSc in Human Biology** (2019), University of Copenhagen
- **PhD in Biology** (2024), University of Sussex

And you can find some more detail in my traditional CV [here]().
