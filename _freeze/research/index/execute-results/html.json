Developing tools for monitoring and controlling natural environmental factors, such as realistic light changes and temperature and humidity; the olfactory landscape. Create ecologically relevant tasks, studying the inner workings of an animal's brain whilst it is interacting with (a close proxy of) its natural habitat.\n\n::: {#research}\n:::\n\n\n## Open science\n\n**Open science.** Open hardware, open software. The majority of my work in this space happens by collaborating on pre-existing projects; open science is team science, and \"lone wolf\" projects too often whither away. *Quantification of animal behaviour*. Testing and trialing software for animal tracking (through video). *Statistics*. Making statistical ... more accessible, making the \n\n::: {#openscience}\n:::\n\n\n## Other research interests\nUnfortunately, time is limited, and I don't have time to work on more projects I find deeply fascinating. Not all living beings have brains, yet the manage to function coherently as s single organism. Plants are able to perform goal-directed behaviour; bacteria can coalesce into biofilms. And it seems a common factor shared across organisms is that they rely heavily on electrical signalling to function as an organism rather than an assembly of individual cells.\n\n## Collaborations\nI am always looking to make new connections, both within, but certainly also across disciplines, so if you think we could work on some fun, interesting questions together, please reach out!\n",
